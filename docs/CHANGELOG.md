# Changelog

This repository records user-visible and compatibility-relevant changes here.
Released sections use Semantic Versioning; unreleased work remains under
`Unreleased` and does not imply a tag.

## Unreleased

### 2026-09-03 08:57 CDT — Define the durable job library contract

Commit: current commit; hash assigned by Git after commit

Affected files:

- `LICENSE`
- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `Makefile`
- `go.mod`
- `docs/**`
- `workflow.toml`
- `workflow/**`

Explanation:

Replace the placeholder claim with explicit requirements, architecture,
runtime boundaries, implementation units, workflow state, and the maintainer's
MIT licensing decision. The admitted mechanism is PostgreSQL 17 with
at-least-once execution and lease fencing; it does not promise exactly-once
external effects or invent a generic backend framework.

Verification:

- PostgreSQL 17 locking and transaction documentation reviewed
- pgx 5.10.0 transaction source contract reviewed
- documentation and workflow consistency inspection

Risks / non-goals:

- Implementation and verification remain pending.
- No tag, consumer pin, remote push, live database, or deployment changes.

### 2026-09-03 00:42 CDT — Establish GitHub public distribution

Commit: `0244f3cfc76058ebc0de0aade689982bdbefa6f5`

Affected files:

- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `docs/distribution.md`
- `docs/RELEASING.md`

Explanation:

Declare GitHub as the public distribution endpoint while retaining Forgejo as
canonical development, define maturity and support honestly, and document the
independent release process. The reserved namespace remains a documentation-only placeholder and makes no API or release claim.

Verification:

- exact old-import search
- documentation contract audit

Risks / non-goals:

- No license is selected.
- No existing tag is changed and no new release is created.
- Mirror direction, repository ownership, and account type are unchanged.
